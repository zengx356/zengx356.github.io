				Hello! My name is Tony Zeng and I am an incoming senior at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. I am pursing a degree
				in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This summer, I will be working as a Software
				Engineer Intern at Thomson Reuters as a contractor through Maverick Software Consulting. Through this internship, I will learn
				the in-and-outs of being a software tester. I will be using C#, Selenium Web Driver, and Visual Studio to help test out
				new features that are to be deployed on Thomson Reuter's product, WestLaw Next and WestLaw Edge.

				My free time outside of work and school consists of a couple different activities. I am a competitive Pump It Up (PIU) player. PIU is a
				rhythm game that is very similar to DDR. I train roughly 3 to 4 days a week as it combines games, exercise,
				and dance all into one. I am also a dancer. I am part of MKDC and was part of the competition team that performed and competed
				across the nation. We have won multiple 1st and 2nd place finishes. As it takes a lot of time to practice and to perform, I have
				decided to focus more of my time towards my academics and my future.

				My current interests lie with Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I remember watching a video of an AI speedrunning
				Super Mario in my intro AI class. The neural network that was shown intrigued me. That is how I started to get into this field.
				The deeper I dive into the topic, the more knowledge I seek, which is why I have decided to focus my remaining time in University
				to study these topics. In my free time, I am actively seeking more knowledge about these topics through courses on Udemy, textbooks,
				videos, and more. My goal after I graduate it to find a full-time position where I can demonstrate my vast knowledge on these topics.
