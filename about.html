				Hello! My name is Tony Zeng and I am a recent graduate from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities and received a degree in Computer science.
				I am currently participating in Google's Engineering Residency Program as a Software Engineer as of July 27th, 2020.
				My previous experience was as a Software Engineer Intern at Maverick Software Consulting where I worked with our client,
				Thomson Reuters with their largest web product, Westlaw Next. Through this internship, I learned the in-and-outs of being a software tester.
				I used C#, Selenium, and Visual Studio to help test out new features that are being deployed on WestLaw Next.
				</h6>

				My free time outside of work and school consists of a couple different activities. I am a competitive Pump It Up (PIU) player. PIU is a
				rhythm game that is very similar to DDR. I train roughly 3 to 4 days a week as it combines gaming, exercising,
				and dancing all into one. I am also a dancer. I was part of MKDC and was part of the competition team that performed and competed
				across the nation. We have won multiple 1st and 2nd place finishes. As it takes a lot of time to practice and to perform, I have
				decided to focus more of my time towards my academics and my future.
				</h6>
				<br>
				<h6>
				I am currently trying out many different things in computer science. Machine learning, front-end development, back-end development, and more.
				My goal for the next couple of years is to discover what I want to work on as a developer. That is why I am taking this opportunity at Google to try out new things
				and figure out what I like and don't like. Thank you ^_^
